**Dynamic Management Code (Updated on 2023-03-15)

The following scripts are written in C# and are designed for dynamic management of simulations. A comprehensive set of dynamic simulation scripts, including those not utilized in this study, can be accessed on GitHub:

[Dynamic Simulation Scripts on GitHub] (https://github.com/MAGALA-RICHARD/apsimXautomationScripts.git)

To utilize these scripts, follow these steps:

1. Download any script of your choice.

2. Open the downloaded script in any code or text editor of your preference.

3. Open your APSIM simulation file.

4. In the field node, right-click and select "Add Model."

5. In the search bar, type "manager" and select "Manager."

6. Select all the text in the downloaded script and paste it into the opened Manager script.

7. Move the cursor to any other node within your simulation to allow the script to compile.

8. Modify the desired parameters as needed to customize the script for your specific requirements.

These scripts are designed to enhance the dynamic management capabilities of your APSIM simulations, offering flexibility and ease of customization for your research and modeling needs.
